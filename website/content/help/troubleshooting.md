## Ace fails with "Unexpected error"

Erm… you probably just hit a bug in Ace.

You can first check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/daisy/ace/issues) to see if some already reported the issue. Don’t forget to included the closed issues in your search in case we fixed it already!

If you can’t find any mention of your issue in our tracker, please [file a new issue](https://github.com/daisy/ace/issues/new)!

You can run Ace with verbose logging (by using the command line option `--verbose`) to provide us with debugging information.
